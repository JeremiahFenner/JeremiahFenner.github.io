    <h2>Causes</h2>
      <div class="main-content">
        &emsp;&emsp;
        Exema is really not actually a disease but rather an immune system reaction, Excema is developed from exposure to environmental toxins. Excema is not genetic 
        and can always be reversed.  <br><br><br>

        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; 1. Immune system overreaction <br><br>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Exema is an immune system overreaction, basically your body has been exposed to too many toxins and it is now very reactive to everything. 
        Immune system overrations can manifest in many different ways (acne, autoimmune disease) and this is just one of them. I believe that excema is mostly caused by food 
        however it is possible it could be a combination of multiple environmental toxins (mold, water, food). <br><br><br>

    <h2>Solutions</h2>
      <div class="main-content">
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; 1. Carnivore diet <br><br>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; The carnivore diet is very well known to fix all skin conditions, the reason for this is because of the increased intake of high nutrient foods, 
        very low inflammation and healthy oil production. The carnivore diet can be difficult to balance because you need to buy healthy meats which are usually more expensive and 
        you need to intake a large ammount of fat because you body will be in ketosis you will need fat for energy production or you could experience lethargy. I would research 
        carnivore heavily and make a plan to slowly integrate it into your diet until you are full carnivore. Then I would stay full carnivore until your excema goes a way and stay 
        on it for 1 month longer. Then I would slowly integrate other foods back into your diet very slowly. If you just go back to your old diet straight after seeing results you 
        will most likely shock your immune system and you will cause your excema to come back again. After you see success I would incorperate fasting into your life because of the 
        huge anti-inflammitory properties that will help your immune system stay calm during the transition back and into the future.<br><br><br>

    <h2>Misconceptions</h2>
      <div class="main-content">
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; As mentioned before excema is not a disease but rather and immune system response and is totally reversable. <br><br>
