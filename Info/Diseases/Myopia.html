        &emsp;&emsp;
        Myopia is macular degeneration, your eyesight is breaking down. Symptoms of this is blurry vison (primarily from a distance) and difficulty recognizing faces and words. Myopia is 
        not normal but rather a result of the unhealthy world we have created. <br><br><br>

        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; 1. Blue light <br><br>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; A primary cause of macular degeneration, Because the mitocondria in your eyes need red light for energy. Almost all indoor lighting now days is only blue 
        light and it is very negative to the health of your cells. Some people indoors get almost no red light because of their working hours, uv filters on the windows and artifical indoor 
        lighting.<br><br><br>

        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; 2. Staring too closely <br><br>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Cases of macular degeneration have been increasing rapidly in Chinese schools because of students staring very closely to their books for long periods of time. 
        Any task where you are staring super close up will be detramental to your eye health. <br><br><br>

        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; 3. Not enough sunlight <br><br>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; All cells in your body need the red light primarily and other wave lengths from the sun to energize your mitocondria. Without this light you cause degeneration 
        of your cells because they begin to not work properly. <br><br><br>
