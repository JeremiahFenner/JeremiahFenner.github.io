    <h2>Causes</h2>
      <div class="main-content">

        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; 1. Low potassium <br><br>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; If your headache is after a workout then you most likely need potassium. <br><br><br>

        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; 2. Sinus pressure <br><br>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Usually caused by allergies or sickness. <br><br><br>

    <h2>Solutions</h2>
      <div class="main-content">
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; 1. Low potassium <br><br>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Celtic salt in water, or some frut with potassium (banana, mangos).<br><br><br>

        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; 2. Sinus pressure<br><br>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; For allergies you can meditate to relieve sinus pressure (focus on the location and tell you immune system to stay calm) or for both you can take a 
        hot shower, sip hot tea with lemon.<br><br><br>

        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; 3. Peppermint oil <br><br>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Apply a small amount of peppermint oil to your forehead and it will feel like icey hot to relax you. (some people say to never use essential oils on your 
        skin but I don't believe it is an issue unless done in large quantities excessively). <br><br><br>
