  <h1>Diabetes</h1>

  <br><br><br><br><br><br>




    <h2>Causes</h2>
    <br><br><br><br>
      <div class="main-content">
        &emsp;&emsp;
        I belive that all 3 types of diabetes are cause by long term and overconsumption of wheat, grains, and sugar(glucose and sucrose). 
        this is because your body has 2 energy modes glycolosis and ketosis. Most modern day people are in glycolosis for their entire lives 
        and it is extreemly unhealthy. Ideally you want to be in glycolosis 30% - 40% of the time and in Ketosis 60% - 70% of the time but the 
        point is that you need a mix of both. In glycolosis your body is taking energy from glucose and using it as fuel, in this mode your body 
        will also transform unused glucose sugar into fat and store it on your organs (liver, heart, skin, kidneys). Storing fat is not necesscarily 
        a bad thing because it is energy saved for later but too much fat and too much visceral fat is very bad and the root of most cronic conditions. 
        in ketosis your body is burning fat as energy (turning fat into keytones) and this is the optimal way your body runs. The issue with being in 
        ketosis constantly without a break is you have to eat large ammounts of fat to keep your energy levels high, however ketosis is extreemly healthy.
        We need to understand these two modes to understand diabetes, the causes are all realated but slightly different I will explain each below.   <br><br><br><br><br>

        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; 1.Type 1 <br><br>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; This type is an autoimmune disease or and immune system response. Your immune system is overreacting fasting will help 
        with this type of diabetes because you are able to calm your immune system, give your immune system a break, and most importantly for diabetes 
        completly remove insulin from your blood stream. <br><br><br><br><br>

        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; 2.Type 2 <br><br>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; This type of diabetes is caused by an unhealthy lifestyle inactivity and overconsumption but diet is the biggest player. what 
        you have basically done is eaten so much bad food so consistantly that insulin never left your blood steam and over a long period of time your 
        body has developed a resistance to this insulin. Anytime you eat carbohydrates or sugar with not enough fiber your body will release insulin into your 
        blood stream to handle the sugar (glucose or sucrose). All sugars and carbs cause insulin but the effect is not as severe with fat and fiber, let me explain. 
        many fruits are high in fiber and milk is high in fat, both of these contian sugar but because of the role of fat and fiber it slows down the digestive process 
        of those foods to allow the sugar to be released slowly into your bloodstream not causing an insulin spike. For this reason with type two diabetes I bieleve 
        you need to fast and control your intake of sucrose and glucose. <br><br><br><br><br>

        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; 3.Type 3 <br><br>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Alzimers is type 3 diabetes, this is where your brain cannot use insulin properly. I believe type 3 diabetes is caused by almost the same 
        things as type 2 but is manifesting slightly differently. first when your body is making keytones your brain is running the most efficently as it can, alternatively 
        your brain does not run that well in glycolosis. However the outerlayer of your brain the meyelin is 90% cholesterol, for this reason I believe that Alzimers is caused 
        by the constant use of glucose and the breakdown of meyelin and for this reason I would suggest intermitent fasting and increased consumption of healthy high cholesterol 
        foods (eggs, red meat, ***BUTTER). To note most doctors will tell you that eggs, red meat, and butter are bad for you, however they are wrong. <br><br><br><br><br>

    <h2>Solutions</h2>
    <br><br><br><br>
      <div class="main-content">
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; 1.Type 1 <br><br>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; For this type I would suggest intermitent daily fasting, and a restriction on carbs and sugar 
        except sugars that contain enough fat or fiber. Also to note Ceylon cinnamon is a healthy alternative to insulin. <br><br><br><br><br>

        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; 2.Type 2 <br><br>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; For this type I would suggest intermitent daily fasting, and a restriction on carbs and sugar 
        except sugars that contain enough fat or fiber. Also to note Ceylon cinnamon is a healthy alternative to insulin. <br><br><br><br><br>

        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; 3.Type 3 <br><br>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Intermitent fasting along with increased consumption of healthy high cholesterol foods (eggs, red meat, ***BUTTER). 
        Lions maine mushroom may also help with alzimers <br><br><br><br><br>

    <h2>Misconceptions</h2>
    <br><br><br><br>
      <div class="main-content">
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; The biggest misconception relating to diabetes is that grains and wheat are helthier than meat and butter, Keep in mind this is 
        only the fact if you are buys grass fed / pasture raised meats, pasture raised organic eggs, and grass fed butter. <br><br><br><br>
