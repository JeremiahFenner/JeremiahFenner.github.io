  <h1>Detox</h1>

  <br><br><br><br><br><br>




    <h2>Causes</h2>

        You may need to do a detox for many reasons here are just some of them, but regardless everyone should detox at least every month.  <br><br><br>

        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; 1. Toxic environment<br><br>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Just about everyone lives in a toxic environment, The only exception might be Japanese people because of their attention to cleansliness. However 
        even if you are a really clean person if you go outside there is brake dust all over the air, governments spray pesticides from the sky, and you have no controll over the tap 
        water and the pipes it runs through. My point being there will always be toxins you canno't account for and that is why doing a detox is important. <br><br><br>

        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; 1. Unhealthy lifestyle<br><br>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Smoking, drinking, drugs, unhealthy food, basically all the fun stuff. <br><br><br>

    <h2>Solutions</h2>
      <div class="main-content">
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; 1. Fasting <br><br>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Fasting is the only real detox method, juice cleanses and other ways do not actually detox the body they just usually add more nutrients you would not 
        normally get. There are many ways to fast but the way that works best for me is everyday intermittent fasting that means I stop eating dinner around 7pm and then skip breakfast 
        and eat my next meal at noon the next day. I will also do a long fast at least once a year usually 4-7 days.<br><br><br>
