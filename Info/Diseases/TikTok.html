    <h2>Causes</h2>
      <div class="main-content">

        &emsp;&emsp;
        Tiktok brain is caused by excessive use of social media applications, symptoms include low dopamine, low motivation, needing your phone like an emotional support animal. 
        If you are addicted to your phone it is definitly not your fault there are billions of dollars being spent to try to program you to stay on the application longer, but 
        regardless you can fix it and here is how. <br><br><br>

    <h2>Solutions</h2>
      <div class="main-content">

        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; 1. Dopamine reset <br><br>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; To reset your dopamine you need to wake up and not touch your phone. You are only allowed to do non artifical dopamine activities like showering, walking. 
        Then skip breakfast and start to work on what you need to do. At lunch have a meal but not a heavy carbohydrate meal. Then start more work. Near the end of the day between 6 - 9 
        that is when you stop working and is your time and you can do whatever you want to. This is a great technique for resetting dopamine and shoutout to Matthew Smith where I learned 
        this technique https://youtu.be/jyLXcy5SGd8?si=a6eJu9IPbO2JCPGD<br><br><br>

        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; 2. Active focus <br><br>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Active focus is a technique where you spend 60 seconds and try to focus on something in your vision. For example I am staring at a ruler on 
        my desk right now and I will set a timer for 60s and try as hard as I can to focus on it completly. This process will help wire your brain into a mode of focus to enable you 
        to do a task you are trying to do instead of focusing on your phone.<br><br><br>
