        Oral health plays a huge role in gut health and gut health plays a huge role in immune health. It is very important to have healthy gums, teeth, and saliva. Also if you notice 
        most of the "standard American" activities are very bad for oral health, processed foods with wheat get stuck in teeth causing cavities, cane sugar is horrible for teeth and 
        the sugar itself feeds bad bacteria, and toothpaste is abrasive and neurotoxic. My biggest concern with name brand toothpaste is the flouride, short term studies have been 
        done showing that the ammount of flouride is safe however no long term studies have every been done. When I consider how flouride is neurotoxic and how the gums are great at 
        absorbtion I know that long term exposure is not healthy, as an alternative there are many ways you can make your own toothpaste, that costs much less. <br><br><br><br><br>

      <h2>My recepie</h2>
      <br><br><br><br>
      <div class="main-content">

        &emsp;&emsp;
        Organic cold pressed coconut oil: kills harmful bacteria, anti-inflammatory, reduces plaque and gingivitus <br>
        Organic ground cloves: Reminneralizes teeth, tastes minty<br>
        Betonite clay: abrasive but not abrasive to teeth, cleans and absorbs toxins (has a hardness rating lower than enamel) <br>
        Charcoal: Whitens teeth and absorbs toxins <br>

        Melt the coconut oil under hot water, mix in cloves, clay and charcoal into a glass container. stir until mixed well. place in the freezer 
        for 3 minutes to cool quickly so the charcoal doesn't sink to the bottom, then let it cool the rest of the way at room temperature until solid.
