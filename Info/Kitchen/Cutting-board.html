        Wood is going to be the best option for all cutting boards. Plastic cutting board leech microplastics into food, however 
        I have not looked into metal cutting boards yet. The best aproach for individuals who eat meat is to have two cutting boards. 
        Keep both boards oiled well and nothing should soak into the board. This will allow you to have clean boards for a long time 
        while using a healthy option. <br><br><br><br><br>

         Maple: Is the best option for cutting boards because of its hardness, abrasion resistance, and tight grain structure which 
         inhibits bacteria growth <br>
         White oak: Is a great second option because of its hardness and water resistance. (more expensive and needs to be oiled more 
         because the grains can catch food particles) <br>
         Oil: I use a mix of beeswax and minneral oil that turns into a paste, completly non toxic and antibacterial. Minneral oil alone 
         is also a good option for cutting boards but I find it messy. <br>

         You can use any hard wood for cutting boards, it is very important to make sure it is oiled well and consistantly to prevent rot 
         and bacteria growth
