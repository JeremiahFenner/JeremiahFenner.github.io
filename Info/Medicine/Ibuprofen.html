    <h2>Ibuprofen</h2>
      <div class="main-content">


        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; 1. Extra virgin olive oil <br><br>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Start with 4 tbsp, and take another in 40 minutes if you are still in pain. <br><br><br>

        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; 2. Golden milk <br><br>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Milk, tumeric, and black pepper. Black pepper for absorbtion <br><br><br>

        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; 3. Peppermint oil <br><br>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Add pepermint oil to your skin for the sensation of icey hot. I use pepermint on my forehead and temples after a hard day to help myself relax.
         There is some mention that essential oils are bad for your skin when applied directly, personally I have had no negative effects from doing this but if you would like 
         dilute peppermint oil with a carrier oil like rosehip or castor oil. (castor and rosehip oil are also very benefical for skin health) <br><br><br>
