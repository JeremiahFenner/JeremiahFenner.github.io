    <h2>Ceylon Cinnamon</h2>
      <div class="main-content">

        &emsp;&emsp;
        There are two types of cinnamon Ceylon and Cassis. If cinnamon is not marked it will say on the ingredients and it is usually Cassia. I started chewing a lot of Cassia cinnamon sticks 
        when I was trying to stop chewing gum (I used to chew a lot of gum but the artifical sweetners where very bad for my digestive health) and one day I was curious if it was healthy so 
        after some research I found that Cassia cinnamon is toxic to your liver (It takes a large dose to see health consequences, but any ammount will impact your health). After some more 
        research I found the alternative which is Ceylon cinnamon. I purchased some and was making coffee when I got the idea to grind cinnamon with it and put it in my coffee for a cinnamon 
        taste. After drinking a glass I was fallig asleep, for a day I thought I was exhausted but then I relaized what I changed about my routing. After more research I found that Ceylon will 
        lower blood sugar. You need a decent ammount for this to happen when eating it whole, however I think that it is more potent if you use two sticks and boil it in about 2 liters of water 
        for 15 minutes. This makes Ceylon a possible sleep aid and a natual alternative to insulin if used correctly.

        Benefits: sleep aid, blood sugar
