        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; 1. Immune system <br><br>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Garlic is a great booster for your immune system because of its anti-inflammitory and anti-microbial 
        properties. Garlic is also proven to boost t-cell, which are primary infectous agent fighters. An old cowboy remedie is to eat a clove of garlic raw when you feel you are getting sick. You can also infuse garlic 
        cloves in honey for an immunity remedie as well.<br><br><br>
