    <h2>Benefits</h2>
      <div class="main-content">

        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; 1. Immune system <br><br>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Fruits are very benefical to your immune system because they have a lot of vitamins, minnerals, and antioxidants. Fruit support cells and reduce 
        inflammation and oxidative stress.<br><br><br>

        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; 2. Sun burn treatment <br><br>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; I have a very light complexion and I got a very bad burn one day, At the time I had been eating very healthy for about 1 year and was experimenting with 
        consuming a large ammount of rasberries and blackberries. I recovered from the burn completely in 3 days and I had no peeling at all, This was very uncommon for a severe sun burn 
        for myself. After some deep thinking I realized the main change in my diet was from the intake of berries. The consumption of the antioxidants lowered my inflammation and boosted my 
        immune system to where I was able to recover extreemly quickly with no permanent damage and for this reason I highly suggest this as a sunburn treatment.<br><br><br>

        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; 3. Antioxidants <br><br>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; These help neutralize unstable molecules, which you can get from a variety of sources, UV, environment, smoking, processed foods.<br><br><br>

        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; 4. Fiber <br><br>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; This is the key to fruit, fibers role slows digestion and limits blood sugar spikes. Natual fiber is also good for your gut microbiome.

    <h2>Misconceptions</h2>
      <div class="main-content">
        
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Fruits contain a lot of sugar are they unhealthy? <br><br> Some fruits are unhealthy but it is not because of their sugar alone. Many fruits contain a 
        significant amount of fiber and fiber will slow the digestion limiting blood sugar spikes. I consider fruits like watermelon that have low fiber, nutrients and high ammounts of 
        sugar unhealthy. Watermelon also ranks very high on the glycemic index. However I believe most fruts are healthy you should always buy organic and pay attention to the ammount of 
        fiber and nutrients they contain, fiber content being the most important.
