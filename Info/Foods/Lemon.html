        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Lemon can be used to clean countertops and cutting boards because of its antibacterial properties and the citric 
        acids ability to break down grease. On counter tops and cutting boards, cut a lemon in half and use half as a scrubber directly. Then wipe 
        down with a paper towel. For sinks powder with baking soda and use half a lemon to scrub as well. This is very effective at disinfecting while 
        leaving a pleasant smell.
