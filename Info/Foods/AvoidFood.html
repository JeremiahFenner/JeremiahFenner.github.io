    <h2>Avoid</h2>
      <div class="main-content">

        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; 1.Processed foods:<br><br>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Processing food has a two tone effect, the first being that nutrients are destroyed during high heat and manipulation. For example a raw steak will have 
        more nutrients than one well done. Also there are a lot of contaminants added to food during processing, In clean facilities this can be dust, and mold left on the machine or in 
        the building, However in dirty facilities this can be as bad as machines that are never cleaned and pests. If you are making a switch to become healthier the first thing to cut out 
        is processed foods. To note when you cut out processed foods you will be subsiquently avoiding many of the other things on this list as well. <br><br><br>

        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; 2.Non-organic: <br><br>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Most importantly for fruit and second most important for vegtables. Pesticides can have a wide range of side-effects and cause long term health problems. Our 
        bodys are great at adjusting to almost anything so you may not feel sick when you eat in-organic fruits and vegtables but if you quit them for two months and try to eat them again you 
        will feel sick because your body has adjusted to healthier food. If you cannot afford organic fruits and vegtables washing them in baking soda can help remove a large ammount of 
        contaminants. Also just becuase the food doesn't make you feel sick does not mean it is not making you sick. <br><br><br>

        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; 3.Cane sugar: <br><br>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Cane sugar is in almost everything from manufactures and the reason is because it is addicting and very bad for your health. Cane sugar spikes your insulin 
        a crazy amount, makes you suseptable to so many diseases and is labeled as a carcinogen itself. Avoiding cane sugar can be very difficult in the modern world but the way you do it is 
        by cutting out things from your diet or swapping them for alternatives one by one until all of it is gone. Date sugar is a great alternative to cane sugar. <br><br><br>

        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; 4.Atrifical sweetners: <br><br>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Artifical sweetners are extreemly toxic to your gut health and very processed. Insects will actually avoid artifical sweetners, you know you should avoid something 
        when even the insects won't touch it. Artifical sweetners are also linked to a host of diseases. There is however only one exception that I believe is okay and that is Xylitol but only if 
        it is derived from fruit. Fruit derived Xylitol seems to have a low impact on gut health and is actually good for oral health.

        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; 5.High fructose: <br><br>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; I don't think I need to explain this one.

        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; 6.Carbohydrates: <br><br>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; For both types of carbohydrates (simple and complex) there are good ones and bad ones, so carbohydrates are not inherrintly bad. However carbohydrates as 
        too widely consumed and most are not healthy. Pasta, bread, and fruit are all examples of carbohydrates that can be healthy but they vary widely. The home made Sourdough bread is 
        going to be good while the store bought white bread is going to be bad. Also when it comes to fruit I don't believe all fuits are healthy, watermelon ranks extreemly high on the 
        glycemic index, has very little nutrients and almost no fiber. As a general rule people should be eating less carbohydrates and healthier ones. Einkorn is a type of native flour 
        that is very healthy for individuals looking for white flour alternatives.
