    <h2>Causes</h2>
      <div class="main-content">

        &emsp;&emsp;
        There can be a myriad of causes for acne the most common causes are <br><br><br>

        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; 1. Dirty environment <br><br>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; A dirty environment is most likely from your job or your daily habits.
        For example when I used to work as a dishwasher there was a mist of water that contained food particles that was dispursed into the air,
        this caused that moisture and bacteria to get onto my skin and as a result I had significant acne from work. It can also be a result of
        your daily habits, In this case it can be two of the options a poor diet and dirty environment. If you are eating a lot of fast food pizza,
        the glucose in the unhealthy dough will cause your natural skin oils to become more sticky and as a result will clog your pores, this combined 
        With not enough bathing (daily habits) will cause acne. (Also to note skin oils are good for your skin and not all foods will cause them to become sticky, 
        oils are not bad but the issue arises when your pores clog) <br><br><br>

        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; 2. Hormones <br><br>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Hormones are a cuase of most acne that people experience which is mostly normal in teenage years because your hormones are flucuating rapidly. 
        However if you have a hormone imbalance this can cause acne. I was once poor and would buy the 2$ gallon milk from the store very often because it was inexpensive and 
        I was hungry all the time during my teenage years, These cows are treated with a significant ammount of hormones to stimulate growth and they are also feed a horrible 
        diet of expired grocery store food items. All of these things pass along into their milk and as a result because of the massive toxin/hormone imbalance I put into my 
        body for a number of years I developed acne. Hormone disruptions can also come from sources other than food as well such as shampoo, suncreen, air quality, tap water. <br><br><br>

        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; 3. Immune response <br><br>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; When your immune system ecounters a toxin for a significant ammount of time that it cannot completely fight off it adapts and learns to live with 
        that toxin, this can cause a compromised immune system. You could be drinking milk with a lot of toxins/hormones for a number of years or months and after your immune system is 
        compromised your body will learn to live with that toxin but become extreemly reactive to all other toxins and you will also see side effects from both. So this is when people 
        become basically alergic to everything or they have a reactions to everything. This is what happened to me and it is the worst case scenario but there is a solution. <br><br><br>

        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; 4. Liver / Defficency <br><br>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Zinc defficenty is a pretty common cause of acne but it can be from other minnerals or vitamins. Your liver plays a huge role in the health of your skin 
        and if you have an unhealthy liver you will most likely have unhealthy skin. I belive liver health and defficencies are linked in the health of your skin.

    <h2>Solutions</h2>
      <div class="main-content">

        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; 1. Dirty environment <br><br>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; The soulution for a dirty environment is the easiest you need to find a way to stay cleaner or change your environment completely. With daily habits you
        most likely just need to be cleaner or bathe more.<br><br><br>

        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; 2. Hormones <br><br>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; You first need to find what is affecting your hormones. This can take time through things like elimination but you may already have and idea what is the 
        problem. Also you need to eliminate for at least 3 weeks to a month to be able to tell if it was affecting you. Next you just need to find a healthier replacement or eliminate, 
        Also there is probably multiple things affecting you so you will most likely need to find most or all of them.<br><br><br>

        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; 3. Immune response <br><br>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; If you are having an immune system response this is bad, first you need to find and eliminate everything toxic. Then you need to live a really clean lifestyle
        for a while to help your body reset, I would also suggest a long fast (3-6) days to try to help eliminate toxins from your and heal your gut microbiome. So read my story in hormones -> causes 
        and if you have a problem like this you can actually drink milk again but it will take some time, After living a clean lifestyle I aquired some very healthy raw milk and after 1 gallon it helped 
        add good bacteria to my gut and 80% of my remaining acne went away over night (be carefull with raw milk you need to get one that is pasture raised, organic, and tested for pathogens). Basically the 
        last step is adding good bacteria back to your immune system AKA your gut.<br><br><br>

        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; 4. Liver / Defficency <br><br>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Defficencies are pretty easy as well you can either take a single vitamin/minneral each month until you find out what you are defficent in or you can take them all at once 
        and eliminate them one by one until your symptoms come back. (To note store bought vitamins suck the best alternative is find foods you like that contain that vitamin). When it comes to your liver 
        you may need to stop drinking so much alchol or your liver may just need some support. Peppermint tea, Green tea, Spearmint Tee, Milk Thistle, Salmon are all great liver supports.

    <h2>Misconceptions</h2>
      <div class="main-content">
        
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Acne treatments: <br><br> Acne treatments do work but they are never permanent and are expensive most of the time cha ching. The reason for this is acne tretments only try to treat the problem not the 
        root cause (a common practice in medecine) and they will use for example salicylic acid to help unclog your pores which it will do but if you don't fix your heavy carb diet your acne will always come 
        back because your oils will always be sticky.
