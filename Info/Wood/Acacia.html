        Acacia wood is very special to me because it is where I got the name for this website. When Moses was leading the Israelites they came to an abandoned town called
        Marah. Marah translates to bitterness and in the bible the story is that the water was bitter (toxic) and they where dehydrated and couldn't drink. So Moses prayed 
        and God told him to place a log in the water and after it was purified and they could drink. This is when I first made the connection between the bible and natural remedies.
        After some research the most common tree in the area was the Acacia tree. <br><br><br><br><br>

        &emsp;&emsp;
        Hardwood: High density hardwood, making it very durable however heavy and hard to cut. <br>
        Tight grain structure: Prevents moisture penetration and bacteria growth. <br>
        High tannin content: Natural perservative for all types of protection, However can leechout if exposed to moisture and stain surfaces. <br>
        Water purification: Bacteria, pathogens, microplastics, and heavy metals. (To note I bileve that acacia will not purify viruses however leaving water in sunlight for 8 
        hours is a good way to kill viruses)<br>
        Antibacterial: resistant to bacteria<br>
        Strong: Can support structural loads, however requires occasional oiling to prevent cracking. <br>
        Oils & Resins: High in oils and resins, helping protect the wood <br>
        Moisture: Low moisture absorbtion rate, and can withstand rain and humidity without warping, swelling, or deteriorating <br>
